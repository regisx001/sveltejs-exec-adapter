# SvelteKit Exec Adapter

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Experimental Project**: This adapter is currently under active development and testing. Use with caution in production environments.

A SvelteKit adapter that builds your full-stack web application as a **single executable binary** with zero runtime dependencies.

Unlike static builds that strip away server capabilities, this adapter preserves **all server-side features** of SvelteKit: SSR, API endpoints, server middleware, server-side authentication, and more.

## Why Use This Adapter?

**Traditional standalone software approaches lose functionality:**

- SPA builds + Rust/Go ‚Üí Lose SvelteKit's server features (SSR, API routes, etc.)
- Desktop apps ‚Üí Can't be deployed to the web
- Docker ‚Üí Requires Docker installation and container management

**With this SvelteKit adapter:**

- ‚úÖ Full SvelteKit capabilities preserved
- ‚úÖ Single binary, no runtime dependencies
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform executable
- ‚úÖ Runs anywhere: locally or on cloud machines

## Perfect For

- **Open-source tools** users can run without Docker/Node.js
- **Commercial software** sold as one-time purchase for self-hosting
- **Privacy-focused apps** prioritizing local data ownership
- **Demos** for users to try before purchasing
- **Portable applications** that need to run without installation

Examples: AI chat apps, project management tools, content management systems, web analytics dashboards...

## Installation

Requires [Bun](https://bun.com/) installed on your machine to build the executable.

```bash
npm install sveltekit-exec-adapter
```

### Installing Bun

Bun is required as a build dependency to compile your SvelteKit application into an executable binary.

#### For Linux and macOS:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Execute the following command to download and run the installation script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

3. After the installation, you may need to add Bun to your system's PATH. The installer usually prompts you with instructions on how to do this, which often involves adding a line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`).

4. Verify the installation by checking the Bun version:

```bash
bun --version
```

#### For Windows:

1. Bun officially supports Windows, and the recommended way to install it is via PowerShell.
2. Open PowerShell as an administrator.
3. Execute the following command:

```powershell
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex"
```

4. Alternatively, you can use scoop if you have it installed:

```powershell
scoop install bun
```

5. Verify the installation by checking the Bun version:

```bash
bun --version
```

> **Note**: For specific version installations, refer to the [official Bun documentation](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) as the commands may vary slightly depending on the desired version.

## Usage

```js
// svelte.config.js
import adapter from "sveltekit-exec-adapter";

export default {
  kit: {
    adapter: adapter({
      binaryName: "my-app",
      // Additional options...
    }),
  },
};
```

Build your application:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run the generated executable:

```bash
./dist/my-app
```

Your SvelteKit app will run at `http://localhost:3000` with **full server capabilities**.

## Configuration Options

The adapter accepts various configuration options. Check the [detailed documentation](./packages/sveltekit/README.md) for complete configuration details.

## Deployment

üéÅ **Bonus**: When targeting `linux-x64`, a Dockerfile is automatically generated, enabling easy deployment with services like Fly.io:

```bash
fly launch
```
